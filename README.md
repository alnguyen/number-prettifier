Code Exercise - Write a number prettifier:

Write tested code (in any OO language, such as C# or Java) that accepts a numeric type and returns a truncated, "prettified" string version.
The prettified version should include one number after the decimal when the truncated number is not an integer.
It should prettify numbers greater than 6 digits and support millions, billions and trillions.
